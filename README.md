# 👁️ Systemic Diseases and the Eye  
## A Demographic Analysis on the Ocular Effects of Diabetes, Hypertension & Cardiovascular Disease

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes the **impact of systemic diseases**—**Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)**—on **eye health parameters**.

The study focuses on how **age and gender** influence disease prevalence and how these systemic conditions affect:
- Visual Acuity (VA)
- Intraocular Pressure (IOP)
- Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
- Drusen Type
- Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze how **age affects diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease**
- Study the **ocular impact** of systemic diseases
- Compare disease prevalence by **age and gender**
- Identify relationships between **systemic diseases and eye degenerative conditions**
- Highlight preventive measures for better eye health

---

## 👁️ Eye Health Parameters

### Visual Acuity (VA)
Measure of sharpness and clarity of vision.

### Intraocular Pressure (IOP)
Pressure inside the eye; elevated IOP increases risk of vision loss.

### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD)
Degenerative disease affecting the macula of the retina.

### Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR)
Ratio between optic cup and optic disc; increases with optic nerve damage.

---

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights

### ARMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration)
- ARMD prevalence **increases with age**
- **Males show higher risk** than females
- Soft drusen increases as ARMD progresses
- ARMD has a **direct relationship** with:
  - Hypertension
  - Cardiovascular Disease
  - Diabetes

---

### Visual Acuity
- Visual acuity **declines with age**
- Males experience more decline than females
- Systemic diseases show an **inverse relationship** with visual acuity
- Higher IOP → Lower Visual Acuity  
  → Indicates higher risk of vision loss

---

### Intraocular Pressure (IOP)
- IOP **increases with age**
- Aging males are at **higher risk**
- Elevated IOP negatively affects:
  - Visual Acuity
  - Cup-to-Disc Ratio

---

### Vessel Tortuosity
- Higher vessel tortuosity observed in older individuals
- Males are more affected than females

---

### Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR)
- CDR enlarges with advancing age
- Males show greater increase compared to females

---

## ⚠️ Precautionary Measures
- Regular blood sugar and blood pressure monitoring
- Healthy and balanced diet
- Regular medication
- Routine eye check-ups
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease significantly **worsen eye health**
- These diseases accelerate **ARMD progression**
- Increased IOP further reduces vision and affects optic nerve health
- Long-term systemic disease presence contributes to:
  - Diabetic Retinopathy
  - Hypertensive Retinopathy
- **Systemic diseases play a major role in accelerating vision loss**
